\input{header}

First of all, take a look at \emph{info.tex}
and fill it out.
Feel free to add your favorite commands to this file,
before you begin to write anything.
You can find a couple of examples there.
For instance, it's probably safer
(and definitely more fun) to use
\textcolor{red}{\textbackslash FirstProf},
\textcolor{red}{\textbackslash SecondProf}, and
\textcolor{red}{\textbackslash ThirdProf},
letting \LaTeX{} to replace them
with actual names.
(Here is what happens:
\FirstProf, \SecondProf, and \ThirdProf.)
You can also find a bunch of boolean variables
in \emph{info.tex}
indicating what appear in the header and what don't.
Finally, there are some length variables
controlling the spacings.
I hope these variables (all provided in \emph{info.tex})
make the template flexible enough
so you wouldn't need to touch other files.
Yet if there are some other things you like to change,
feel free to take a look at
\emph{SoP-style.tex} (for general style)
and \emph{header.tex}
(for the header and some other things).

For those of you who are not familiar with \LaTeX,
the following basic commands may be useful:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item \textbackslash textit for \textit{italic};
\item \textbackslash textbf for \textbf{bold};
\item \textbackslash underline for \underline{underline}.
\end{itemize}

If there is any problem with this template,
don't hesitate to contact me :D Good luck!

%% Position of the signiture (left or right)
